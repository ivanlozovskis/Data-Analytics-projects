Here are my Data Analysis projects.\n
CoursePlatformAnalysis.ipynb:\n the aim of this project is to analyze online courses' data and develop insights that can help optimize and improve the courses. The project covers the following areas:\n
Course Description  The course description analysis revealed that certain courses had higher enrollment rates and completion rates than others. The courses that had lower enrollment and completion rates were recommended to be optimized for better performance.\n
Instructor Workload: The instructor workload analysis revealed that certain courses had high instructor-to-student ratios, leading to potential instructor burnout or lower-quality instruction. The courses with high ratios were recommended to hire additional instructors to reduce workload and improve instruction quality.\n
Content Quality Analysis: The content quality analysis revealed that certain modules were problematic and required improvement. The courses with problematic modules were recommended to optimize the content for better student engagement and learning outcomes.\n
Seasonality Analysis: The seasonality analysis revealed that certain courses had enrollment trends that were influenced by seasonal trends. The courses with seasonal trends were recommended to be optimized for better performance during peak seasons.\n
Student Performance Metric: The student performance metric analysis revealed that certain students were struggling with the course. The courses with struggling students were recommended to provide additional support such as tutoring or mentorship to improve student learning outcomes.\n
Overall, this project provided valuable insights into online courses' performance and identified areas for optimization and improvement.
